The Europeans also brought animals such as pigs, horses and cattle. The indigenous peoples also adopted these which allowed for an even greater population as well as better transportation.\n",

    "Finally, war causes an extreme jump in industrial production and technological advancement. For example, in WW2, because of the need for more machines and resources, the Soviet industries skyrocketed.
